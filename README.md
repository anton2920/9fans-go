# Overview

## Description

This repository contains packages for interacting with Plan 9 as well as ports of common Plan 9 libraries and tools.

## Differences from 9fans.net/go

This fork was modified so useful `acme(1)` applications run on fourth edition of Plan 9.

Currently I've tested:

- [x] `acme/Watch`
- [x] `acme/acmego`

# Installation

```
$ go install github.com/anton2920/9fans-go/...@latest
```
